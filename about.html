                    <p class="me">I am an eager professional with a lot to offer. I have had a valuable and diverse Graphic Design experience and training which I believe has provided me with a flair for design. Currently pursuing a Bachelor's in Graphic Design at California State University East Bay.  Anything that I lack in experience I make up for a a desire to work hard and learn as much as I possibly can. I am well versed in different areas of design and have successfully designed solutions for print media and mobile media. I am comfortable with Mac OSX as well as Windows. In addition, I have in-depth knowledge about almost all top designing software, including the following: Adobe Photoshop, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Illustrator, Keynote, PowerPoint, and Adobe Acrobat Professional.</p>
